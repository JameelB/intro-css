    Linked CSS is the most common method of attaching style rules to
    an HTML document. The style rules for the HTML document is
    contained within an external .css file. The css file is linked
    by adding the link tag to the header section of the HTML document.
    The link tag is required to have the following attributes and values
    to specify that it is linking a css file:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li> 
      rel="stylesheet": This specifies the relationship between the current document
      and the linked document
    </li>
    <li>
      type="text/css": This specifies the type of the file linked
    </li>
    <li>
      href="style.css": Specifies the location of the linked document
    </li>
  </ul>
