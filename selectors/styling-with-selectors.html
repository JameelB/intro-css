  <p> 
    Selectors are patterns used to select the element you want to style.
    There are multiple selectors that we can use to target a specific element(s).
  </p>

  <h2 class="subtitle">  Using the Element Tag as a Selector </h2>
  <p>
    Element tags can be used as a selector. <br>
    When using an element tag, all of the elements with that specific tag
    will have the style rule applied to them. <br>
    This is specified in css as <b> [tagName] { ...[style rules]... } </b> <br>
    <b> For Example: </b>
    <p class="css-example"> 
      p { color: blue; }
    </p>
  </p>

  <h2 class="subtitle">  Using Classes as a Selector </h2>
  <p>
    HTML elements can be assigned a class attribute. Classes can be used
    to identify more than one element. <br>
    When a style rule is applied to a class, it will apply that rule
    to all HTML elements that has that specific class value. <br>
    In CSS, class selectors are specified by <b> .[className] </b> <br>
    <b> For Example: </b>
    <p class="css-example"> 
      .sampleClass { color: black; }
    </p>
  </p>

  <h2 class="subtitle"> Using IDs as a Selector </h2>
  <p>
    HTML elements can be assigned an id attribute. IDs should be unique
    to each element and can only be used to identify one element. <br>
    When a style rule is applied to an id, it will that rule to that
    specific HTML element that has that specific id value. <br>
    In CSS, id selectors are specified by <b> #[idName] </b> <br>
    <b> For Example: </b>
    <p class="css-example">
      #sampleId { color: black; }
    </p>
  </p>
